# Crazy Desmos Expressions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run .
```

This will start an interactive REPL where you can enter numbers and see the results of the crazy long math expression.
To change the number of iterations, enter `iters = <number>`.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.4. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
